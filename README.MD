# DESCRIPTION:
- These are code snippets that clients and copy and paste into a custom.js or similar file to load our script and styling code
- In some catalogs, it is possible to add the html tags directly, and so this extra step is unnecessary.

# Integration Examples:

* For all examples, replace `<SUBDOMAIN>` inside the respsective files with the appropriate client subdomain.

* After selecting the appropriate file, click on the button "raw" and then you can safely copy and paste the code into the appropriate html or js file for your system.


## New Primo:
- file: custom.js
- You will see two versions in the typical custom.js file. Try either one. Either one should work.


## Standard Integration /w jquery:
- file: custom.html
- These are script and link tags to be dropped in your catalog that run our custom code.


## Standard Integration w/0 jquery:
- file: custom.html
- These are script and link tags to be dropped in your catalog that run our custom code.
